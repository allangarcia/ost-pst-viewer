New Prices Launch July 1st - Buy Now To Beat The Increase

John Owens, the team lead for the Scotland team.Over the past year we've introduced a number of new products, our full Aspose.SharePoint range, the very recent addition of Aspose.Diagram for .NET and Aspose.Network for Java as well as the constant updates of Aspose.Total. Going forward we don't plan to stand still, we're heavily investing in our full product range as well as R&D to bring you new file format related products that will help make your life easier and revolutionise your applications.

Despite this impressive portfolio our prices have remained the same for over five years. To allow us to continue providing excellent technical support as well as progressing the Aspose product portfolio we will be raising our prices on July 1st.

In the meantime, please feel free to purchase before July 1st to beat the price increase <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=105537110524> .

App Stores and the Fun of Buying Software.

I was recently browsing the AppStore and came across a nice little app called "Commodore 64", as an 80's child I couldn't resist. I paid my money and started creating some pretty innovative software <http://www.aspose.com/newsletters/062011/images/C64Capture.jpg> .

Browsing the in-app purchases took me way back! I remember the weeks of impatient saving and the highly anticipated trip to the shop to buy the latest game. I bought Last Ninja III and was playing it within a minute. I'm sad to say that after about five minutes the notion had passed and it was relegated to my pile of apps I'm unlikely to use again.

I'd be keen to hear your thoughts <mailto:editors@aspose.com> : has the fun been taken out of buying software or is the AppStore's way of doing things much more enjoyable? Some Aspose goodies will make their way to the most interesting reader story.

(At Aspose, we only offer electronic delivery of our products; we hope that this doesn't detract from your enjoyment of the software!)

Many thanks,
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

Changes to Licensing

An icon symbolising support.Some of our users find our license types and subscriptions confusing. To make them easier to understand, we have re-organised the purchase section of the website and renamed the license types. The new license names are: Developer Small business, Developer OEM, Site Small Business, Site OEM. The Small Business licenses map on to what was previously known as Enterprise licenses. If you have any questions, read our new FAQs <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=085801110523> , or contact the sales team. The End User License Agreement <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=090440110523>  has been updated to reflect these changes.

Migration Tip - Wrapping text in cells in Aspose.Cells for .NET and VSTO

<http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=092027110523> http://www.aspose.com/Newsletters/052011/images/office-automation-to-aspose.png <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=09202711052>  <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=092027110523> Sometimes, the text entered into a cell is longer than the cell is wide. Making the cell wider affects the entire column, so often the best solution is to wrap the text in the cell, automatically making the cell tall enough to contain all the text. In a .NET environment, you can do this using VSTO, or you can do it using Aspose.Cells. This tip shows you how <http://www.aspose.com/adtracker/?code=092027110523> .
